# **2D Maze Game - Sphere Navigation**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a simple 2D game developed for a Compiler Design mini-project. The objective of the game is to navigate a sphere from the top of a maze to the bottom using keyboard controls. The game showcases basic event handling and real-time movement mechanics while offering a fun, interactive experience for the player.

## **Features**
- **Keyboard Controls**: The game uses arrow keys for movement, providing intuitive gameplay.
- **Objective-Based Gameplay**: The player must bring the sphere to the bottom of the maze without hitting obstacles.
- **Restart Functionality**: A button to reset the game, allowing the player to start fresh.
- **Minimalist Design**: Simple and clear user interface for easy navigation.

---

## **Gameplay Mechanics**
The player controls a sphere, moving it up, down, left, or right using the keyboard arrow keys. The goal is to navigate the maze's platforms and walls to reach the bottom of the screen. Upon completing the objective, the game restarts or can be manually reset via the restart button.

## **Challenges Faced**
- **Movement and Collision Handling**: Ensuring smooth and accurate movement of the sphere while preventing it from passing through walls.
- **Script Integration**: Integrating various elements like movement logic, restart functionality, and collision detection required precise coordination.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- **New Levels**: Adding more complex mazes and difficulty settings to increase the challenge.
- **Visual Enhancements**: Improving graphics, animations, and possibly adding sound effects.
- **Scoring System**: Introducing a score or timer to track how quickly players complete the game.
